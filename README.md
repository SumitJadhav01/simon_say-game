# About
Creating a Simon Says game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a fun project that can help you learn about DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic.  

A Simon Says game is a classic memory and pattern recognition game where players repeat a sequence of colors or sounds. The game tests the players' ability to remember and reproduce increasingly longer sequences accurately. 

# Gameplay steps:
When the user clicks the 'Start' button, the game begins by highlighting a random color in the sequence.

The player must then click the corresponding colored buttons in the same sequence.

If the player correctly reproduces the sequence, the game moves to the next level.

If the player makes a mistake, the game ends, and they can restart by clicking 'Start' again.
